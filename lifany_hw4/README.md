## HW4 Deep Learning


For questions 3-5, follow the instructions in the `hw4.pdf` to fetch the data. Alternatively you can download the data from the link below and unzip it in the `hw4/` directory

For question 6, you will have to install pytorch on your system. We recommend `v1.12.1`

Using pip:

`pip install torch==1.12.1+cpu torchvision==0.13.1+cpu torchaudio==0.12.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`

A CPU only installation should work just fine for the HW4 but you can install the GPU version to speed things up. PyTorch might have trouble with some old GPU architectures, if you face any issues please come to OH.
